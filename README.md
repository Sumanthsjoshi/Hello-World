Hello People,

Here are some of my favourite quotes:

  You've got one go in life, so make the most of it.
  A business has to be involveing; it has to be fun, and it has to exercise your creative instincts.
  You can often judge the character of a person by the way he treats his fellow men.
  Get off your backside and do something positive.
  I find I don't learn a lot while I'm talking.
  We are all born with a divine fire in us. Our efforts should be to give wings to this fire and fill the world with the glow of its goodness.
  Good student could learn more from a bad teacher than a poor student from even skilled teacher.
  Learning without wisdom is of no use.
  A good plan violently executed right now is far better than a perfect plan executed next week.
  When you are the anvil, bear - When you are the hammer, strike.
  The opposite of love is not hate. Hate is just love gone bad. The actual opposite of love is apathy. When you don't care a damn as to what happens to the other person.
  Whether a man is a legend or not is decided by history, not fortune tellers.
  Truth doesn't have to be liked. It only has to be spoken. Speak it out. The truth may hurt you, but it will set you free.
  The key question isn't 'What is Evil?' The key question is 'When does the Good become Evil?
  It's our greed to extract more and more from good that turns it into evil.
  What is forgotten, however, is that many times the Good we create leads to Evil that will destroy us.
  Weak people never admit that they are responsible for their own state. They always blame either circumstances or others.
  
That's it for now.
